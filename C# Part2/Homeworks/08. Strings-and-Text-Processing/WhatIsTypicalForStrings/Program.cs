             * In computer programming, a string is traditionally a sequence of characters, either 
             * as a literal constant or as some kind of variable. The latter may allow its elements 
             * to be mutated and/or the length changed, or it may be fixed (after creation). 
             * A string is generally understood as a data type and is often implemented as an array 
             * of bytes (or words) that stores a sequence of elements, typically characters, 
             * using some character encoding. A string may also denote more general arrays or other 
             * sequence (or list) data types and structures.
             * (by wikipedia)
             * 
             * 
             * Most important methods :
             * 
             * Length, this[], Compare(str1, str2), IndexOf(str), LastIndexOf(str), Substring(startIndex, 
             * length), Replace(oldStr, newStr), Remove(startIndex, length), ToLower(), ToUpper(), 
             * Trim()
