/* Define abstract class Human with first name and last name. Define new class Student

 * properties for this hierarchy. Initialize a list of 10 students and sort them by grade 
 * in ascending order (use LINQ or OrderBy() extension method). Initialize a list of 10 
 * workers and sort them by money per hour in descending order. Merge the lists and sort 
 * them by first name and last name.
